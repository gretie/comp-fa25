        <p class="subtitle">Student Projects | Fall 2025</p>
        <p class="course-description">In this first-year EMA course students explore contemporary art ideas and practices as they use code as a creative medium to create art. Students learn to read and write code in the programming language P5.js. They  explore and develop understandings of key programming concepts while using these computational and logical tools to build digital and interactive artworks. </p>
        <p class="course-description">The projects below are self-selected projects by students, which highlight their favorite, most challenging (conceptually or technically), or simply their most delightful creation.</p>
     <p class="course-description"> In addition to the interactive projects below, all students' Project 12: Computationally-Generated Pattern can be seen on the large LED screen.</p>
